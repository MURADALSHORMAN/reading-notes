## reading Summary

building components and applications with React steps: (Links to an external site.)
1-  Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy:
to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names.

2-  Build A Static Version in React:
to implement your app.

3-  Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State:
to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with state.

4- Identify Where Your State Should Live:
to identify which component mutates, or owns, this state.

5- Add Inverse Data Flow:
to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in FilterableProductTable.
