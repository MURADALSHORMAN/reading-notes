## Review, Research, and Discussion

- ### What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
Packet switching is used to optimize the use of the channel capacity available in digital telecommunication networks, such as computer networks, and minimize the transmission latency (the time it takes for data to pass across the network), and to increase robustness of communication.


- ### UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
UDP is a connectionless protocol. It is known as a datagram protocol because it is analogous to sending a letter where you don't acknowledge receipt. Examples of applications that use connectionless transport services are broadcasting and tftp .


- ### Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?

Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to

- ### Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to.

- ### Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
- In a connection-oriented client-to-server model, the socket on the server process waits  Note: Currently, IBM supports two versions of most sockets APIs. ... When an application has a socket descriptor, it can bind a unique name to the socket.


# Observer Pattern
is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods
# Listener
The event handler function
# Event Handler
scripts that are automatically executed when an event occurs
# Event Driven Programming
In computer programming, event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions .
# Event Loop
In computer science, the event loop is a programming construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. ... When the event loop forms the central control flow construct of a program, as it often does, it may be termed the main loop or main event loop.
# Event Queue
An event queue is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system. Event queues are often used in the context of an enterprise messaging system.

# Call Stack
In computer science, a call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program. 

# Emit/Raise/Trigger
hese words are synonymous and refer to when an event is being created using the emit() method
# Subscribe
This is a JavaScript object that defines the handlers for the notifications you receive. The subscribe() call returns a Subscription object that has an unsubscribe() method, which you call to stop receiving notifications.
# database
A database is a data structure that stores organized information
