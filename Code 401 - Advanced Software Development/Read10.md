# Stacks and Queues

## What is a Stack?
A stack is a data structure that consists of nodes. Each node references the next node in stack but not reference to itâ€™s previous.


## Common terminology for a stack is
- Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
- Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- Top - This is the top of the stack.
- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

# What is a Queue

a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.

## Queues follow these concepts:
- FIFO First In First Out
This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

- LILO Last In Last Out
This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.
