## What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?

The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.

# Differences Between API Documentation, Specifications, and Definitions

## What is API Documentation?

API documentation is essentially the reference manual for an API – It tells API consumers how to use the API. API documentation is meant for humans, usually developers, to read and understand. Providing documentation that is well-designed, comprehensive, and easy to follow is crucial when it comes to ensuring developers have a great experience with the API. And a great developer experience (DX) means a better chance for API success. If developers can’t follow your API documentation, they’ll likely find another API with better documentation and would be easier to integrate. 

## What is an API Specification?
API specification is a term that is often used interchangeably with API definition. While these terms have many similarities, they are different entities. An API specification provides a broad understanding of how an API behaves and how the API links with other APIs. It explains how the API functions and the results to expect when using the API. A good example of an API specification is the OpenAPI Specification.

## What is an API Definition?

An API definition is similar to an API specification in that it provides an understanding of how an API is organized and how the API functions. But the API definition is aimed at machine consumption instead of human consumption of APIs. An API definition provides information about how the API functions, how it links with other APIs, and the expected results in a machine-readable format. It focuses on defining the API and outlining the structure of the API.

# Web Server
A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP, the network protocol created to distribute web pages,[1] or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a specific resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. The server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.

A server can be a single computer, or even an embedded system such as a router with a built-in configuration interface, but high-traffic websites typically run web servers on fleets of computers designed to handle large numbers of requests for documents, multimedia files and interactive scripts. A resource sent from a web server can be a preexisting file available to the server, or it can be generated at the time of the request by another program that communicates with the server program. The former is often faster and more easily cached for repeated requests, while the latter supports a broader range of applications. Websites that serve generated content usually incorporate stored files whenever possible.

Technologies such as REST and SOAP, which use HTTP as a basis for general computer-to-computer communication, have extended the application of web servers well beyond their original purpose of serving human-readable pages.


 # Express

### Web Applications
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
### APIs
With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy
### Performance
Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you know and love.



#  Routing

Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks. ... Packet forwarding is the transit of network packets from one network interface to another. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as routers, gateways, firewalls, or switches.
