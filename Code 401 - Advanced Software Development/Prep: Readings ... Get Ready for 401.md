# How to Solve Programming Problems

1. Understand
Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).

2. Plan
Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

3. Divide
Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry. Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.


### A simple set of steps:

Read the problem completely twice.
Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
Optimize the manual steps.
Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
Optimize the real code.

#### What is the programming mentality?
Let's think about programming as speaking for a moment. When you speak, you’re aiming to communicate effectively with the people around you.
When you program, you’re aiming to communicate with a machine. In both cases, you don’t need to know every single word or element of a language, 
you just need to know enough that you convey your ideas so that they are understood.
