# Hook :
### How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS? 
Vanilla JS requires a lot of typing : JS requires a lot of codes so would be little messy and that make it less efficient than React.

React JS is for code organization :ReactJs is great for organizing the code. as you can see all the above code is on one page, script.js.

“React :A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. Since React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, it’s easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project”.

“Vanilla.JS: A fast, lightweight and cross-platform framework. It is a fast and cross-platform framework for building incredible, powerful JavaScript applications. it is the most lightweight framework available anywhere”.



## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
### Functional Components
Stateless, can be created with a function abc syntax or implied with an arrow function. Accept and use props, and don't use render().

## Children / Child Components
Child components are nested components that inherit props from their parent.




## Preview

- Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
- Functional component , child compnent , class vs functional components
- Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo? Functional component , hooks , state updates ,react life cycle
- What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works? Mounting unmounting and these things that are related to react life cycle ,more about DOM

## When would I use a Hook?
- If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component.
