# Component Based UI:
 ## Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)?
- Angular
- Vue.js
- jQuery
- Backbone.js
- Polymer

### What’s the difference between a framework and a library?

The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the application flow. You choose when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides you with a few places to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed. Framework is often more restrictive and generally have a more set of rules.Whereas, Library is not bounded by many rules.

## Define the Following Terms
- Rendering
Rendering is the “painting” of a web page onto the screen. Essentially rendering is the displaying of the code onto the webpage
- Templates
Templating refers to the “client side data binding method” used in Javascript. Templating often requires a template engine and this essentially outsources some of the work to the web browser.

- State:
What is State? The state is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.

## what is JSX? 
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript. It allows us to directly write HTML in React (within JavaScript code). It is easy to create a template using JSX in React, but it is not a simple template language instead it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

## Rendering Elements: 
Rendering an Element into the DOM:

-  Rendering Elements
```
<div id="root"> <div/>
```

Let’s say there is a < div> somewhere in your HTML file,We call this a root DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM. Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

- libraries
- state
#### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
- hooks
- a better way to set state
- nothing comes to mind yet
#### What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
mostly hooks.
