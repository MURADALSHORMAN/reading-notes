# Why is access control important?
Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach.


# Describe an application that would need access control.


Access control is a method of guaranteeing that users are who they say they ... organizations need it the most, and the challenges security professionals can face. ... access must be dynamic and fluid, supporting identity and application-​based ...


# What is a role used for?
is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is an approach to implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, 
user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments. A study by NIST has demonstrated that RBAC addresses many needs of commercial and 
government organizations.RBAC can be used to facilitate administration of security in large organizations with hundreds of users and thousands of permissions.
Although RBAC is different from MAC and DAC access control frameworks, it can enforce these policies without any 
complication.

# Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is the strictest of all levels of control. The design of MAC was defined, and is primarily used by the government.

MAC takes a hierarchical approach to controlling access to resources. Under a MAC enforced environment access to all resource objects (such as data files) is controlled by settings defined by the system administrator. As such, all access to resource objects is strictly controlled by the operating system based on system administrator configured settings. It is not possible under MAC enforcement for users to change the access control of a resource.
Mandatory Access Control begins with security labels assigned to all resource objects on the system. These security labels contain two pieces of information - a classification (top secret, confidential etc) and a category (which is essentially an indication of the management level, department or project to which the object is available).


## Authorization

Authorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular. More formally, "to authorize" is to define an access policy.

# Role Based Access Control


Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

Employees are only allowed to access the information necessary to effectively perform their job duties. Access can be based on several factors, such as authority, responsibility, and job competency. In addition, access to computer resources can be limited to specific tasks such as the ability to view, create, or modify a file.

As a result, lower-level employees usually do not have access to sensitive data if they do not need it to fulfill their responsibilities.
This is especially helpful if you have many employees and use third-parties and contractors that make it difficult to closely monitor network access. 
Using RBAC will help in securing your company’s sensitive data and important applications.
