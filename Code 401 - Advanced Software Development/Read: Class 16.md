### Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app 

### Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
a server is a computer or program which manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network. it provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, so its the part that we send requests to and get responses from

### What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
deployment refers to the process of running an application on a server or device. The goal of a deployment Making an application available to end-users. and it includes all of the processes involved in getting new software or hardware up and running properly in its environment, including installation, configuration, running, testing, and making necessary changes.

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Server : it is a code that exisiting in a computer, this code deals with the user interface or client requests to do some actions based on these requests. mainly organizing and storing data and make some extra things and processes.

- Pub/Sub : publisher - subscriber. represents how events work, by publishing the event by someone, then everyone listned to this event as a subscriber will run this event for it when it’s published. in other words Pub/Sub is a flexible, reliable, real-time messaging service for independent applications to publish and subscribe to asynchronous events.

- WRRC : web request-response cycle. represents how every web service or process done when a client does some action in the user interface.

## Virtual Machines:
- A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps
- Virtual Machines Maneger : it is type of software that allows us to run an operating system within another operating system.
## VMS and the Cloud:
- What is Virtualization: Virtualization enables users to disjoint operating systems from the underlying hardware, i.e, users can run multiple operating systems such as Windows, Linux, on a single physical machine at the same time.
- Hypervisor: A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.
- Cloud computing : is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.


## AWS:
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services

## Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2):
is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment
