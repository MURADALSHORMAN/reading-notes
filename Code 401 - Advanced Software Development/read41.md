* Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”

* Ducks is a way to bundle reducers, action types, and actions into the same file.

* Rather than splitting up related code, it can be packaged into redux modules. Redux Toolkit’s goal is to help simplify common Redux use cases. It is not intended to be a complete solution for everything you might want to do with Redux, but it should make a lot of Redux-related code you need to write a lot simpler. Redux Toolkit exports several individual functions that you can use in your application, and adds in dependencies on some other packages that are commonly used with Redux.

## What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

It helps to solve three major problems with Redux: configuring a Redux store, adding numerous packages to get Redux to things, and removing unnecessary or boilerplate code.
